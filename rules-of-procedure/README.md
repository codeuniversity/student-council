#### Stylistic Changes by Council Members
All members of the student council are allowed to make changes to proposed amendments regarding the formatting and stylistic nature of the document. This may affect headlines, use of italics, bold or similar. Direct changes to the content from council members are prohibited and need to be suggested by separate pull request. 

## Passing Your Amendment

Once a suggested amendment has been discussed and is in it's final version, a vote can be held to pass it in a Student General Assembly. The student council invites to these meetings. The students council informs all students about the proposed amendment prior to the assembly. 

An amendment requires the approving majority vote of two thirds of the participating members of the Student Assembly ([ยง8 of the Statute](https://github.com/codeuniversity/student-council/blob/main/statute/statute.md#8---amendment-of-legal-provisions)).

After a vote, the associated Pull Request of the proposed amendment will be flagged with *Passed* or *Rejected* by one of the student council members respective to the vote results. Additional details on the vote will be appended to the Pull Request as a comment.

### Successful Vote

If an amendment has been passed by vote, it is ready to be merged. The current version will be [archived](archive). This archived version will be appended as a commit to the amendment's Pull Request. This can be done by any of the council members. 

Council members need to make sure that the date of the version of the passed amendment matches the date of the day of voting.

The chairperson of the student council approves and merges the finalized Pull Request. 

### Rejected Vote

If an amendment is rejected by vote, the branch and Pull Request will remain open. 

Students have the right to make changes to the proposed amendment and request a new vote.
